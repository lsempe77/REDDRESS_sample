## Introduction

For many people with severe stigmatising skin diseases, lack of access to health and social services results in significant physical and psycho-social consequences, complex treatment journeys, and catastrophic socio-economic impacts. Our research aims to reduce illness, stigma, social exclusion and poverty caused by severe stigmatising skin diseases (SSSDs) in Liberia. Improving fair access to services is an important cornerstone of universal health coverage (UHC) (the provision of key health services to everyone, regardless of socio-economic status, disability or gender, for example) and in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. UHC requires action beyond single disease programmes and approaches to ensure that no one is left behind. Integrated health system approaches to managing skin diseases have been proposed as a key solution to these challenges.

Liberia is one of the first countries in the world to develop a national integrated approach to managing SSSDs. This means managing diseases with signs on the skin (e.g. lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, Buruli ulcer, yaws and onchocerciasis), through a combined approach at the local level. However, there is limited evidence about patient knowledge, priorities and experiences and the equity and effectiveness of the current approach.

REDRESS will develop new knowledge with regional and global relevance on affordable, timely, appropriate and improved treatment strategies that also reduce stigma and address other social issues for affected vulnerable populations. Our project has been co-developed between researchers, patients and programme implementers at the request of the Liberian NTD programme and directly responds to priority health needs, detailed in the country’s ‘Investment Plan for Building a Resilient Health System’.

The purpose of this document is set the guidelines and suggest a sampling strategy for the implementation and evaluation of the REDRESS project.

The study of the intervention and the evaluation will collect primary
data exclusively in the three treatment counties: **Lofa** for ***Study
A***, and **GrandGedeh** and **Margibi** for ***Study B***.

There is an agreement between partners to select two districts of each
county, which will allow to capture geographical and socio-economic
diversity.

## Criteria

We suggest the combination of following criteria to select the
districts:

-   Urban/rural density in order to reflect different health and social
    dynamics;

-   Larger number of health clinics in order to have a larger pool of
    potential health facilities to survey;

-   Districts with larger number of SSSD cases registered in 2019 and
    2020, understanding that prevalence is relatively low in population
    and there is a need to capture a significant number of observations
    to gain as much as statistical power as possible.

## Prevalence

The severe stigmatising skin diseases that we are focused on in REDRESS are neglected tropical skin infections that can cause significant illness to an affected person through lack of treatment or prevention and often result in morbidity and disability. Several Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) present in the skin including destructive skin ulcers and elephantiasis. These diseases contribute to the global burden of Severe Stigmatising Skin Diseases (SSSDs) and constitute one of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide. Stigma associated with these diseases can lead to social exclusion and psychological distress. 

Considering there is are relatively low number of SSSDs, we review
evidence of prevalence of the diseases in recent years. @simpson2019 did
a systematic review of **Buruli ulcer** prevalence worldwide. Prevalence
estimates within study areas ranged from 3.2 (95% CI 3.1-3.3) cases per
10000 population in Côte d'Ivoire to 26.9 [95% CI 23.5-30.7] cases per
10,000 population in Benin. There was evidence of Buruli ulcer in 32
countries and consensus on presence in 12.

@timothy2021 conducted a population-based cross-sectional integrated
survey for skin NTDs (Buruli ulcer, leprosy, lymphatic
filariasis--associated morbidity, and yaws) during June-October 2018 in
Maryland County, Liberia (census population 165,456). The find confirmed
endemicity and autochthonous transmission of **yaws** in Liberia after a
population-based, community-led burden estimation of 24 cases, 2.6 [95% CI 1.4-3.9] cases/10,000 population). Aside from 1 case in a 32-year-old person, all confirmed cases were in persons <18 years of age, most of whom were male.

@cromwell2020 estimate a posterior probability that the prevalence of
**lymphatic filariasis** by immunochromatographic test as of 2018 was
unlikely to be below 1% in Ghana, Liberia, northern Democratic Republic
of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire. @who2021 reports 109 new cases of
**leprosis** (registered prevalence) in Liberia in 2019. Finally,
@melchers2021 estimate a prevalence lower than <0.05% for
**onchocerciasis** in Liberia.

Data from the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Liberia also provides
additional insights. Table \@ref(tab:raw) shows the number of cases from
the selected diseases from 2017 to 2019. We observe that years 2017 and
2018 show a larger number of reported cases, where leprosis, buruli
ulcer and lymphatic filariasis show the higher number of cases at
country level. It is worth noticing that at county level, the highest
single value found is 42 cases of buruli ulcer in Lofa in 2017.

Table \@ref(tab:incidence) shows the computation of the incidence of new
cases by 10,000 inhabitants. This suggests, if compared to the
previously aforementioned prevalence/incidence data a potential
combination of under-reporting and low prevelance.

: (#tab:incidence) Incidence by 10,000 inhabitants in selected counties
and national level by SSSDs - 2017 to 2019

## Sample proposal

In the following tables, we present summary statistics for the three
intervention counties. In each case, we argue in favour of selecting
certain districts based on the aforementioned criteria.

Table \@ref(tab:lofa) shows 7 districts in Lofa County, where we
identify two potential districts: Foya and Voinjama (where the County
capital is located) are the ones with larger number of health facilities
(3rd and 1st), among the largest share of population covered (1st and
3rd, respectively) and the largest number of SSSD cases identified in
2019 and 2020 (1st and 2nd, respectively).

An alternative could be the Kolahum District. However, we found news
that suggest the district has been partitioned into smaller
portions[^1], although we could no find official information the
boundaries.

Table \@ref(tab:margibi) shows 4 districts in Margibi County. We find
three potential districts. First, the Kakata District, where the capital
is located and it is the most populated and with the largest number of
health facilities - although there where only 1 SSSD in 2019. Second,
the Mambah-Kaba District, which is second in number of health facilities
and first in number of cases. Finally, the Firestone District appears as
a candidate due to the larger relative population and the highster
number of registered cases in 2020.

marg<-Sampling_frame %>% filter (County == "Margibi" ) %>%
  group_by(County,District) %>% summarise (`# Health Facilities`=n(),
                                           `Population covered`=sum(`Population covered`,na.rm = T),

                                           ),

Table \@ref(tab:grand) presents districts from the Grand Gedeh county,
where the Tchien district appears as the best candidate in terms of
higher population, health facilities and SSSD cases identified in 2020.
The other districts do not show very relevant differences in terms of
population and SSDD cases. Based on that, we suggest choosing the
Cavalla District as it has the largest pool of health facilities (6)
among the remaining districts.

gg<-Sampling_frame %>% filter (County == "Grand Gedeh") %>%
  group_by(County,District) %>% summarise (`# Health Facilities`=n(),
                                           `Population covered`=sum(`Population covered`,na.rm = T),
                                           `# SSSD cases 2020` = sum(`SSSD cases 2020 (total)`,na.rm=T
                                           ),
                                           `# SSSD cases 2019` = sum(`SSSD cases 2019 (total)`,na.rm=T
                                           ))

## Map

The following map presents 89 Health Facilities mapped by USAID in
2014/2015, that where matched to the database REDRESS received. There
are 40 additional Health Facilities in the REDRESS database (n=139) that
could not be geolocated.
